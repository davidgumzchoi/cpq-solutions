#CPQ Solutions Website 2.0

This repository features a proposed solution for our CPQ Solutions homepage as a static website using vanilla javascript
Moves our website out of heavy Wordpress solution to render more quickly leveraging Github (maybe surge.sh) as its backend

The homepage will be a brief view into each subpage (company, solutions, services, clients)

Highlights on each CTA especially and quick access to "Contact" and send message using a focused pop-up modal
s
Clear branding and consistent messaging

## How to use this repo
Updates will be made using Github Pages or surge.sh, but may be exported to another CMS for future updates

**To view the final single page app:**
```
# from this repo
git checkout master
```

## Set Up
```
# clone the repo
git clone <this-repo>
cd <this-repo>

# view the app
cd CPQ Solutions
index.html
```
